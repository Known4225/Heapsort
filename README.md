This is an update to my old python program "Heapify"
It has the same functionality but in this version I don't make use of the keyboard module (not preinstalled) and instead use my own turtletools module
Run the program with python, enter "none" into the Auto prompt
Press the space key to advance the animation
Works on Linux and Windows
